### Custom Commandline Commands:

As of now we're only having *load_stock_by_file*, probably we're going to have more in the future
to run it you need to run the following script where csvfile is the path of the file you're looking for loading:
```
python3.8 manage.py load_stocks_by_file /path/to/your/csv/file/ --delimiter ';'
```
**the *--delimiter* option is optional in case you're using a different delimiter, you can specify it but by default it's a semicolon (;)**
